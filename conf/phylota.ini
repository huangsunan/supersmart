; parameters for merging clusters. In principle we could use 'blast', 'inparanoid'

; specified as MERGE_OVERLAP. We will only retain alignments whose divergence does
; not exceed BACKBONE_MAX_DISTANCE (to prevent saturation) and we will join alignments
; such that each exemplar species participates in at least BACKBONE_MIN_COVERAGE

; parameters for genus trees. within the genera we might accept more rapidly evolving
; loci, hence the CLADE_MAX_DISTANCE might exceed BACKBONE_MAX_DISTANCE. This is
; because we might assume less saturation. The CLADE_MIN_DENSITY specifies how

; If variables whose names end with DIR or FILE point to relative paths, and
; prefixing them with the value of environment variable $SUPERSMART_HOME turns
; these into absolute paths that point to something (which is the intended
; behaviour), then the Config.pm object that operates on this file will return
; those absolute paths instead. This is because some of the steps are done on a
; cluster where different nodes will see a different directory layout.
