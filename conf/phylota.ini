; we should do this as follows:
; - by default all binaries are assumed to be on the PATH
; - we don't hardcode binary locations in this config file under git
; - all binaries should be called <name>_BIN

; Configuration for setting up the database and parsing the sequences.
; If variables whose names end with DIR or FILE point to relative paths, and
; prefixing them with the value of environment variable $SUPERSMART_HOME turns
; these into absolute paths that point to something (which is the intended
; behaviour), then the Config.pm object that operates on this file will return
; those absolute paths instead. This is because some of the steps are done on a
; cluster where different nodes will see a different directory layout.
