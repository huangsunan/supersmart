Requirements 
==================================

-- an installation of 'VirtualBox'
-- an installation of 'Vagrant'
-- a connection to the internet
-- an SSH client

Quick installation guide 
(see below for extended version) 
==================================

-- If not already installed, download and 
   install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
-- If not already installed, download and
   install Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
-- Change to the configuration directory 'conf/'
-- Issue command 'vagrant up'
-- Log in to the virtual guest machine using 'vagrant ssh'
-- SUPERSMART is installed in the directory '/usr/local/src/supersmart', i.e. $SUPERSMART_HOME


Extended installation instructions
==================================

The SUPERSMART pipeline is designed to run on a virtual 
guest operating system within the 'VirtualBox' software, 
using the 'Vagrant' and 'puppet' environments. 
This means that SUPERSMART is not actually installed on your machine
but runs on a virtual linux guest machine which is downloaded
from a remote server to your computer. Vagrant takes care of downloading
the virtual image on which SUPERSMART runs. After downloading,
not only SUPERSMART, but also all necessary dependencies 
(e.g. external software and libraries, databases) for the  
pipeline will be automatically installed. It is thereby ensured 
that all software tools used in the pipeline run in a controlled
environment. 

You can download VirtualBox and Vagrant for all common operating systems 
at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
and http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html.
You will find installation instructions on the respective websites.

Once Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed
on your system, open a terminal ('command prompt' on Windows) 
and change to the SUPERSMART project directory (the location
to which you downloaded the SUPERSMART project).
Change then to the 'conf/' directory and run Vagrant.

$ cd conf
$ vagrant up

Vagrant will now download the virtual machine and 
SUPERSMART together with all necessary dependencies
will be automatically installed by 'puppet'.
Please not that this may take some time.
When the installation is finished, you can
log into the virtual machine and change to the
SUPERSMART working directory.

$ vagrant ssh 
$ cd $SUPERSMART_HOME

For instructions on how to run the pipeline,
please refer to the README file in the 'examples/'
directory.


Logging into the guest machine on WINDOWS
==================================

Please note that an ssh client is not
installed by default installed on Windows
systems. In order to log on to the virtual
Linux guest machine, you need to download and
run an ssh client, e.g. 'putty'; you will find
a download link at http://www.putty.org/ .
Putty does not require any installation steps,
you can just double click on the downloaded
file and a dialog window will open asking you for
the connection details. 
In the field 'Hostname (or IP address)',
enter: 127.0.0.1
In the field "Port", enter: 2222 and press
'Open'. A command prompt will open and ask you
for a user name and password. For both, username and
password, enter 'vagrant' to log in.
